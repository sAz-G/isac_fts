This code is for the project seminar "ISAC from the Sky: UAV Trajectory Design for Joint Communication and Target Localization" by Markus Krantzik and Sharif Azem.

You will need to install cvx in order to be able to run the code.

Running the code:
 - go to parameters.m, read the comments there and set the parameters.
 - If you want to run the multi_stage algorithm, run multi_stage_script.m in src/main_algorithm/multi_stage/
 - If you want to run monte carlo simulations, go to src/main_algorithm/monte_carlo/
